TODO:
1. Rework to prevent playing in a square a player has already played in.
2. Add Dynamic newGame button.
3. Add detected win condictions.
4. Write script to build canvas's much better. Can be recursive/looping.
5. Rewrite canvas to use event detection instead of onClick tags. (Better for some reason? Not sure why.)
